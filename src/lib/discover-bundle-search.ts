 * Discord, thread "I can't launch Wan2.2" (15.10.2026): the reporter typed
 * "FramePack" into the search and got nothing. The FramePack bundle is filed
 * under Unfiltered, the page opens on Mainstream, and the search only looked
 * inside the open tab. A name search that answers "nothing" for a model the
 * catalogue carries reads as "LU does not have it". While a search is typed
 * it now looks in both tabs; without one the tab decides as before.
