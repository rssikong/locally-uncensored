/**
 * The intents that have a REAL local pipeline on an MLX host (Apple Silicon
 * Mac). Every local lane above is a ComfyUI graph, and the Mac has no ComfyUI
 * at all — its local media is the in-process MLX path (api/mlx-image.ts,
 * api/mlx-video.ts). MLX generate accepts prompt / steps / seed / size /
 * negative and nothing else, and there is no ComfyUI /upload/image to stage a
 * source through, so plain text-to-image and text-to-video always run.
 *
 * Animate Image is the one lane with a source that MLX serves too: some video
 * models start from an image (the catalogue in commands/video.rs says which),
 * and the image is staged on disk instead of in ComfyUI (loadImageRef). It is
 * a local tab only while such a model is installed, which is what the
 * `mlxAnimate` argument below carries (api/mlx-video mlxTakesStartImage).
 *
 * Extend Video rides on the same models (14.10.2026): as on Windows, the last
 * frame of the picked clip becomes the start image of an image to video run
 * (LocalExtendControls, lib/video-frames lastFrame). So it is a local tab
 * exactly while Animate is one. The engine's own `extend` mode, which carries
 * the clip on in latent space, is a beta of ltx-2-mlx and needs the dev
 * transformer the distilled packs leave out; it is not used.
 *
 * Remove Background runs on every Mac: the subject mask comes from the Vision
 * framework of macOS (commands/mlx_cutout.rs), with no model to install and
 * no ComfyUI node, so the tab needs neither.
 *
 * Everything else must NOT look like a working local tab — see visibleIntents
 * / isIntentLocked below.

 * Edit is the second lane with a source that the Mac serves: Qwen-Image 2.1

 * does on Windows (commands/image_mflux.rs). It is a local tab only while such
 * a model is installed, which is what `mlxEdit` carries (lib/image-engines
 * mlxTakesEditImage). A mask painted over the first image limits the edit to
 * that area (mflux 0.22.0 `--mask-image`); without one the prompt edits the
 * whole image.
 *
 * Enhance Image is a local tab on the Mac while an upscaler is installed:
 * SeedVR2 on the second engine makes the picture on the Stage two or four
 * times larger (commands/mlx.rs mlx_upscale). That is what `mlxUpscale`
 * carries (api/mlx-image mlxUpscalerInstalled). Without one it stays locked,
 * as it is everywhere else in local mode.
 *
 * Music too: ACE-Step 1.5 runs as a process of its own on the Mac
 * (commands/music.rs), and the Music tab is a local tab while its engine and
 * model are installed, which is what `mlxMusic` carries (api/mlx-music
 * mlxMakesMusic). Without it the tab stays locked, as before.
 *
 * Motion Control (3.0.8): an LTX-2.3 pack of the second video engine with
 * the IC-LoRA Union Control follows the motion of a video from a start image
 * (commands/video_motion.rs). The tab is local while such a pack is
 * installed, which is what `mlxMotion` carries (api/mlx-video
 * mlxFollowsMotion). The LoRA itself comes with the tab's install card.
 *
 * Talking Character too (3.0.8): LTX-2.3 4-bit turns a portrait and a voice
 * into a clip whose lips follow the speech (the engine's `a2v`,
 * commands/video_ltx2mlx.rs). The tab is a local tab while such a model is
 * installed, which is what `mlxTalk` carries (api/mlx-video mlxTalking); the
 * extra download the run reads is offered on the tab itself.
