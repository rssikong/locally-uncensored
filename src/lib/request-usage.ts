/**
 * Tokens per answer, the line under it and `/usage`.
 *
 * Discord 22.10.2026 (#general): "Whats the cmd to see how much tokens was
 * used in the previous request?" The app had the numbers and showed none of
 * them: `message.usage` is the context counter's anchor and keeps only the
 * LAST model call of an answer, which is right for "how full is the window"
 * and wrong for "what did this request take". An agent answer makes several
 * calls, each one reads the whole prompt again, and the request took their
 * sum. So the sum lives in its own field, `message.requestUsage`.
 *
 * Only what a backend reported counts: Ollama's prompt_eval_count/eval_count,
 * usage.prompt_tokens/completion_tokens of an OpenAI compatible server (LU
 * Engine, LU Cloud, LM Studio), Anthropic's input/output tokens. A call
 * without numbers adds nothing, and an answer without any shows no line.
 * There is no estimate here on purpose: a char/4 guess under an answer reads
 * like a meter reading.
 *
 * Credits: the app does not learn what an answer cost. LU Cloud books it on
 * the server (cache, upstream cost) and sends only how it billed the request
 * (`x-lu-chat-billing`). So a Flash answer on the free allowance says
 * "No credits", the same word as the model picker, and a credit answer says
 * that it used credits without inventing an amount.
