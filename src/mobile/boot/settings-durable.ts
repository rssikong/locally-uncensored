/**
 * A setting that was just changed survives the app being killed.
 *
 * Settings live in the localStorage of the WebView (the settings store under
 * `chat-settings`, and a few phone keys of their own). The WebView hands a
 * write to localStorage on to the disk with a delay: measured on Android, a
 * setting changed 0.3 s before a hard end of the app was back at its old
 * value after the restart, from 2 s on it was kept (acceptance Android,
 * re-run, N5). The iOS simulator showed the same. IndexedDB does not have
 * that delay: a chat written in the same moment was still there.
 *
 * So every write to one of the settings keys is copied into a small database
 * of its own at once, together with the moment it happened. At the next
 * start the copy is held against localStorage: when the copy is newer,
 * localStorage lost its last writes, the values of the copy are put back and
 * the page loads once more with them.
 *
 * What makes this safe:
 *  - Only a NEWER copy counts, by the stamp both sides carry. A copy that is
 *    as old or older changes nothing.
 *  - localStorage must still know an older stamp. Without one this is a
 *    fresh or emptied storage, and bringing settings back there would undo
 *    a reset.
 *  - `localStorage.clear()` drops the copy.
 *  - Without IndexedDB, or when it fails, nothing changes: the settings are
 *    in localStorage as before.
 *
 * What this cannot promise. The copy is handed to IndexedDB in the same tick
 * as the write, but IndexedDB is asynchronous: the transaction is done a few
 * milliseconds later, not within the tap. A kill inside those milliseconds
 * loses the change, and nothing a page can do closes that gap. A copy that
 * failed is tried again when the app goes to the background.
 *
 * At a full phone (round 30, B3). The copy is one row with every key, the
 * large stores included, so with no space left its write fails with a quota
 * error: that is reported (the shell says a setting is not saved) and tried
 * again after SETTINGS_COPY_RETRY_MS and when the app leaves the screen; the
 * older row stays. Seen on Android after hard ends at a full phone: the copy
 * was gone altogether (IndexedDB of a WebView is storage the system may
 * clear when space runs out), and once localStorage had lost the consent and
 * the note of the notification question, keys written once and never again,
 * while its stamp was a new one. A localStorage that knows no stamp is
 * treated as fresh here on purpose, so this copy cannot bring such keys back.
 * The two decisions that must not get lost therefore have a second home in
 * the native layer (policy/decision-vault.ts), like the age answer.
