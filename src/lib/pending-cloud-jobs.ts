// The cloud renders this device is still waiting for, kept across a restart.
//
// A cloud job is booked and paid the moment the submit returns. Its id used to
// live in a module variable of hooks/useCloudCreate.ts and nowhere else. A
// phone that kills the app in the background (it does, routinely, during a 5
// minute video render) lost the id, and with it the only way to reach a result
// the customer paid for.
//
// This file is the small ledger: one entry per booked job, written right after
// the submit, removed when the job reached an end state and its result is in
// the gallery. lib/cloud-job-resume.ts reads it after a start and after every
// return to the foreground.
//
// localStorage on purpose, not the create store: the entry has to be on disk
// before the next line of code runs (the system may freeze the WebView at any
// point), and it must not ride on a store that rewrites its whole gallery.
//
// Before the ledger there is the intent (durchsicht-mobile H2): the id of a
// job used to exist only in memory between the tap and the answer of the
// submit. A phone that killed the app in exactly that window left a booked,
// paid job nobody could reach, and the next tap booked a second one. So the
// `client_request_id` is written down BEFORE the request leaves ("sent, answer
// open"). The server books the first job of a run under exactly that id
// (the id is the key of the first job there, further images of one run get
// siblingId(id, index)), so after a restart the
// app only has to ASK for that id. It never sends the submit a second time by
// itself: a job that exists is picked up, a job that does not exist was never
// booked, and no tap can end in two paid jobs.
//
// Only a phone writes entries. The desktop keeps its own rule (the window
// stays open for the length of a render), so its ledger is always empty and
// everything that reads it finds nothing to do.
