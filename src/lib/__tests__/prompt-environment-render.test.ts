/**
 * Task 215: the environment block has to reach the prompt that actually ships.
 *
 * 2.6.6 gave the coding and agent loops two lines: a platform sentence that
 * says which machine the agent stands on and which shell shell_execute opens,
 * and a clock line that replaced the retired clock tool. Both were proven as
 * functions, and the position of the clock was proven by reading the source.
 * Nobody ever built a prompt and looked inside it. A builder that stops
 * interpolating the line is a silent loss: the prompt still renders, the run
 * still works, and the model quietly goes back to guessing `explorer` on a Mac
 * and spending a step on `uname`.
 *
 * So these tests render. They call the builders that ship and read the string
 * that comes out.
 *
 * The split they check is plan A5. The platform sentence reads the same on
 * every turn and belongs in the stable head, where an upstream prefix cache can
 * match it. The clock changes every minute and belongs at the very end, because
 * a cache matches from byte 0 and stops at the first difference: a timestamp
 * near the top re-prices the whole prompt on every single turn.
