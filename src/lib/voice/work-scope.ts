// What a voice session may do on the computer, and where.
//
// Two switches sit at the top of the Voice surface. "Agent" decides whether
// the model may work on the computer. Off, it still looks things up on the
// web, as the plain chat does since 3.0.7 (GitHub #187: a voice question
// about today got an answer from the training data). "Where it may work"
// decides how far the agent reaches:
//
//   workspace  Files only inside the folder of the session (the file tools
//              are held there by the path jail on the Rust side), commands
//              start in that folder and ask every time, no screen.
//   computer   Files and commands anywhere the user's own permissions allow,
//              plus the screen.
//
// A third level, a sandbox that really isolates commands, is not here
// because LU has none: a command is a program on this computer, and nothing
// in the app can fence in what it does once it runs. That is also why the
// workspace level asks before every command and refuses one that names a
// place outside the folder: the refusal is a tripwire for the honest case,
// the question is the boundary.
//
// This file decides, the executor enforces: the session asks it which tools
// to offer, and the tool bridge asks it again before every single call. No
// React, no store, no network.
