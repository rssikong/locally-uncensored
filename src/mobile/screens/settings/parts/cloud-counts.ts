/**
 * How many models the LU Cloud page (E3) names, per store preset.
 *
 * The page names a number BEFORE anybody is signed in, so there is no list
 * to count yet: the numbers stand here, counted by the one rule of
 * cloud-count-rule.ts (decision D1, mobile-docs/plaene/LU-CLOUD-SEITE.md)
 * from the catalogue this app carries. The total is computed, never typed.
 * Once an account is signed in and its lists are loaded, the page counts the
 * lists it really shows instead (cloudCountsSeen below).
 *
 * Derivation, counted 17.10.2026 (mobile-docs/r51/cloudseite.md), chat
 * counted again for the catalogue of 24.10.2026:
 *  - chat 48: the 44 rows of lib/no-refusals-measurement.md (DeepSeek R1 and
 *    GLM 5.1 left the catalogue on 24.10.) plus four that joined after that
 *    run: DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, Kimi K3.1 Pro, MiMo V2.6 Pro and Nemotron 3.5
 *    Super VL (the same 48 as lib/cloud-pitch.ts chatModels).
 *  - image 15: the 10 classic image models of lib/render/cloud-models.ts and
 *    5 studio models that make a picture from words (Z-Image Base, Nucleus,
 *    JibMix Qwen, Wan 2.2 Realism, Qwen Image 2.1). Not the 3 studio twins.
 *  - video 24: the 15 classic video models, and 9 studio models: OpenVideo
 *    (with its Style LoRA endpoint, one model), Seedance 2.5, Seedance 2.5
 *    Turbo, MiniMax H3 (text, image and reference, one model), Wan 3.0 (image
 *    and reference, one model), Wan 3.0 Spicy, Wan 3.0 Prime, Wan 3.0 Prime
 *    Spicy, LTX 2.5 (text and image, one model). Not the twins, not extend,
 *    upscale, lip sync, motion, restyle or sound.
 *
 * open and play list the whole catalogue (play the marked models under the
 * mark "Direct"), so they name the same numbers. appstore leaves models out
 * and lists fewer, and how many chat models it lists depends on a mark only
 * the server sets (`unrestricted`): no number before sign in (decision D2).
 *
 * Count again before every release. __tests__/cloud-counts.test.ts recounts
 * from the catalogue and holds every number against a written out value.
