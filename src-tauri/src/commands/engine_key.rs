//! The key the LU Engine answers to.
//!
//! Found in the security pass of 2026-10-13: llama-server has no login, and it
//! writes the origin of every request back into `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
//! So any web page open in the user's browser could talk to the engine on
//! 127.0.0.1: read its state, read what sits in its slots and run the model.
//! Reproduced on the Mac build of the same server.
//!
//! The fix is the server's own lock. Every engine LU starts (chat and
//! embeddings) gets one key, made fresh when the app starts and handed over in
//! the environment (`LLAMA_API_KEY`), never on the command line where every
//! program of the user can read it. The web view never learns it: everything
//! that talks to the engine goes through the Rust side, and the Rust side puts
//! the key on exactly the requests that go to a port an LU engine holds.
//!
//! What stays open: llama-server answers a few addresses without a key
//! (`/health`, `/models`, `/v1/models`). They say that an engine runs and which
//! model it has loaded, nothing of what was asked or answered.
