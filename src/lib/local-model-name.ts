/**
 * The name a local model carries in the model picker.
 *
 * A local model is a file, and the picker showed the file name with its
 * underscores taken out. For a model that came from the Model Manager that is
 * a second name for the same thing: the box, 03.10.2026, installed the card
 * "Noct Q (Qwen-Image 2.1, Unfiltered)" and then had to recognise it in the
 * picker as "NoctQ V4 int8 convrot". A file the catalogue lists is shown
 * under the name the catalogue gives that file ("Noct Q V4 (INT8)"), which is
 * short and still tells two quants of one model apart. The file name stays
 * reachable as the row's tooltip and in the search. A file the catalogue does
 * not know (a CivitAI download, the user's own) keeps its file name.
