/**
 * The sentences the logic layer writes into an answer that are not the answer.
 *
 * The chat hook and the agent loop tell the desktop what went wrong by writing
 * a sentence into `content`: the bubble of the desktop shows it. Some of these
 * paths also write the field (`Message.error`), most do not. A reader that
 * takes `content` for the text of the answer then shows the sentence as if the
 * model had said it, copies it, reads it aloud and puts it into the preview of
 * the chat list (acceptance on the large iPhone, G8: "The connection dropped
 * before the model finished its answer" as the answer of a model on the phone).
 *
 * `splitLogicNote` is the one place that knows these sentences. It is built
 * from the constants the writers use, so a changed wording is followed. The
 * few sentences that are literals in the hooks are pinned by a test that reads
 * the hooks (lib/__tests__/logic-notes.test.ts).
 *
 * Pure. `lib/message-error.ts` asks it for every message without the field.
