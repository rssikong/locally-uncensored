/**
 * A37, Discord "Ghidra and REA", xxcoder, 26.10.2026:
 *
 *   "that after I had to restart llm since it was repeating"
 *   "looks like rea only work on first run of llm, and if restarted, it wont work"
 *
 * and the model's own words: "I don't have that tool directly available."
 *
 * REA's 207 tools are routed per turn on the user's words. The words were the
 * newest message only, so the turn after a stopped run ("continue", "start making
 * the project", "list the procedures again") was offered no REA tool at all,
 * while REA itself was running fine. Asking the first question again brought
 * them back, which is why it looked like a restart problem.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/plugins/__tests__/rea-tools-stay-for-a-follow-up.test.ts
