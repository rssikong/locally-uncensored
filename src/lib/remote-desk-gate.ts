/**
 * A phone turn for a chat that is not open on the desktop, while someone
 * types at the desktop: LU does not jump away from what they are doing.
 * Instead a bar says "Your phone continued <Chat>. Open", and the turn runs
 * once they open it, or once nobody typed for a minute. When nobody typed
 * in the last minute, the turn runs at once, as before (CHATS-V1.md).
 *
 * Pure with an injected clock and timers; the window wires it to keydown and
 * to the chat that is open (lib/remote-chats-start.ts).
