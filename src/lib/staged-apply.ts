 * Measured against the real queue on the Windows box, 2026-08-14: `oldContent`
 * and the file on disk both carry CRLF, because that is what a Windows editor
 * writes, and the model writes `newContent` with LF. Compared as bytes, EVERY
 * line differs from the baseline, so mergeThreeWay sees one replaced block
 * spanning the whole file and any foreign edit inside it reads as a collision.
 * The user is told their edit touches the same place, which is not true.
 *
 * The quieter half is on the happy path: writing LF content over a CRLF file
 * flips the whole file and turns a three-line change into a full rewrite in
 * everyone's diff.
 *
 * So compare and merge on LF, and write back in the form the FILE has. The
 * model's choice of ending is an artefact of the model, never a decision.

/**
 * Decide what to write when the file moved on since it was staged.
 *
 * A staged change carries the file as it looked when the model wrote it. The
 * user reviews the diff and clicks Apply minutes later, and in between the file
 * may well have changed: they fixed a line themselves, another tool ran in the
 * same folder, or an earlier entry of this very queue landed. Writing
 * `newContent` blindly reverts all of that, with no undo.
 *
 * Refusing was the first answer to that, and it turned into its own bug: every
 * file in Morgan's finished run refused, so a plan the app reported as done
 * wrote nothing (2026-08-11). Refusing is only correct when the two edits
 * really collide. So:
 *
 *   1. baseline intact       -> write what was approved
 *   2. already that content  -> nothing to do, treat as applied
 *   3. foreign edit elsewhere-> merge both and write the result
 *   4. same lines both sides -> refuse, this one needs a human
 *
 * An empty `oldContent` means "there was no file here", and that used to skip
 * the whole check. It is also what useCodex writes when the stage-time read
 * merely FAILED, so a new-file write could land on top of a file that exists
 * now, with no drift check, no merge and no warning. Empty is a baseline like
 * any other: an empty base against a file that has content is exactly the
 * insert-against-insert case mergeThreeWay already refuses, and refusing with
 * the message below beats overwriting somebody's file in silence. A file that
 * genuinely is not there still throws on the read and takes the create path.
