//! The local music engine of the Mac: ACE-Step 1.5.
//!
//! On Windows and Linux a track is a ComfyUI graph on the all-in-one ACE-Step
//! checkpoint. A Mac has no ComfyUI, so here the engine runs the way the
//! other Mac engines run: a venv of its own at one pinned commit, the weights
//! of the official repository at one pinned revision, and one Python process
//! per track that the app starts, reads and can end.
//!
//! Why a process per track and not the engine's REST server: the server has
//! no way to cancel a task (`docs/en/API.md` names none), so a Stop would have
//! to end the whole server anyway, and a server that stays up keeps every
//! model in memory beside the image and video engines. A process that ends
//! gives all of it back.
//!
//! Every statement about the engine below was read from its source at the
//! pinned commit (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `acestep/inference.py`,
//! `acestep/audio_utils.py`, `acestep/llm_inference.py`,
//! `acestep/model_downloader.py`,
//! `acestep/core/generation/handler/init_service_orchestrator.py`,
//! `acestep/core/generation/handler/progress.py`), 14.10.2026. Nothing was
//! installed and no track was made with it yet: the real run is
//! `real_run_mac::music_run`.
//!
//! Where it was read:
//!   - the code, MIT: <https://github.com/ACE-Step/ACE-Step-1.5> at `COMMIT`
//!     (`requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.13"`, the darwin arm64 pins of
//!     `uv.lock`, the macOS start scripts with `ACESTEP_LM_BACKEND=mlx`)
//!   - the REST server and its two calls, with no way to cancel a task:
//!     `docs/en/API.md` at the same commit
//!   - the weights, MIT: <https://huggingface.co/ACE-Step/Ace-Step1.5> at
//!     `REVISION`, the four folders by the hub's file listing
//!   - why the runner writes the WAV itself: `torchaudio.save` of
//!     <https://github.com/pytorch/audio/blob/v2.10.0/src/torchaudio/__init__.py>
//!     and the FFmpeg note of <https://github.com/pytorch/torchcodec>
//!   - the memory floor: the tier table of `docs/en/GPU_COMPATIBILITY.md`,
//!     which puts the 1.7B language model at 12 GB and more
