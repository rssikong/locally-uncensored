/**
 * Consume one provider.chatStream turn into the same result shape that
 * chatWithTools returns, while feeding live callbacks along the way.
 *
 * This is the shared piece of the 2.6.0 streaming normalisation (the owner
 * 2026-07-31): Code and Agent mode used to stream only on the Ollama
 * transport and sat silent on every other provider until the whole call
 * returned. Every transport now goes through chatStream — tool defs travel
 * in ChatOptions.tools, tool-call deltas accumulate inside the provider and
 * arrive on the done chunk.
 *
 * Callbacks receive the CUMULATIVE text first (what the existing UI paths
 * paint directly) and the raw delta second (what the Hermes display filter
 * feeds on). `onToolProgress` hears about a call while its arguments are still
 * arriving, so the run can name it before the done chunk.

 * No watchdog of its own here. Until 30.09.2026 this file wrapped chatStream

 * tool-call arguments accumulate inside it without a yield. A long file_write
 * on a native model therefore looked stalled while its bytes were still
 * flowing, and the run died with "Stream stalled" in the middle of the write
 * (customer case a user: 43 aborted requests, the run ended, "continue"
 * repeated the step). Dead lines are caught where the bytes are: readChunks in
