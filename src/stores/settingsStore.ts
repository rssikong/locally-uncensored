// v5 (Feature EE v2.5.0): added settings.exclusiveVramMode. The migrate below
// already merges { ...DEFAULT_SETTINGS, ...persisted.settings }, so bumping the
// version is all that's needed — the new default fills in while every existing
// user value is preserved. Rehydration is NOT broken: a persisted v4 blob runs
// the same merge path that has handled every prior additive field.
// v6 (the web app design port): added settings.personasEnabled (master persona
// switch, default true). Bumped so existing users get the default ON instead
// of an undefined → falsy "personas off" surprise.
// v7 (Small-Model Mode v2.5.0): added settings.smallModelMode (lean profile
// for 3B-8B local models, default false). Same additive merge path below
// ({ ...DEFAULT_SETTINGS, ...persisted.settings }) fills the new default in
// while preserving every existing user value — existing users get it OFF.
// v8: added settings.userAvatarDataUrl (user profile picture, default ''),
// backfilled by the same additive merge — existing users keep the default icon.
// v9 (v2.5.3): added the model-picker preferences preferredImageModel /
// preferredVideoT2VModel / preferredVideoI2VModel (all default '' = "ask
// before the VRAM swap"). Same additive merge path — existing users simply
// see the picker on their next generation.
// v10 (2026-06-16): one-time RESET of those three picker preferences. Video had
// kept a silently-saved model and only offered "Change model"; the owner wants the
// full picker to come FIRST again on both image AND video. Clearing the saved
// picks once on upgrade makes the picker the default until the user deliberately
// saves a model again via the picker's Remember.
// v11 (2.5.7): added settings.appMode (global Local/Cloud switch, default
// 'local'). Same additive merge backfills it — without the bump, v10 blobs
// skip migrate entirely and the header ModeSwitch renders with appMode
// undefined, highlighting neither Local nor Cloud.
// v12 (2.5.7): added settings.comfyGpuMode ('auto'|'cpu'|'gpu', default
// 'auto') for the AMD ComfyUI GPU path (rhodium92). Additive — the merge
// fills the default while preserving every existing value; NVIDIA unaffected.
// v13 (2.5.7): added settings.cloudOnboardingSeen — REMOVED in 2.6.0: the
// one-time onboarding moved into the web checkout (#91); stale persisted
// values are ignored by the merge.
// v14 (2.5.8): added settings.cloudTeasersEnabled (Cloud discovery in Local
// mode: locked Create tabs + hosted-model picker rows, default true). Additive.
// v15 (2.5.9): added settings.codexCloudConfirmShell (default true). The cloud
// shell-confirm was hard-wired in useCodex, so the existing confirm toggle did
// nothing on a cloud model. Additive merge backfills the default — behaviour is
// byte-for-byte what 2.5.8 did until the user turns the new switch off.
// v16 (2.5.9): added settings.loopMaxPasses (default 0 = unlimited). Additive,
// but the bump is what makes the merge RUN — without it an existing profile
// keeps the field undefined and the Settings number box renders empty, which
// is how this was caught on the ship exe (2026-07-25). Behaviour was already
// correct via `?? 0`; this is so the UI shows the real value.
// v17 (2.5.10): added settings.codexAutoApply (default false) — auto-apply
// staged changes when the run finishes. Additive merge backfills the default;
// stage-mode behaviour is unchanged until the user turns the new switch on.
// v18 (2.6.0): added settings.builtinEngine (expert tuning for the bundled
// llama-server: ctx, flash attention, KV-cache quant, threads, GPU layers,
// mlock/mmap; defaults = the exact pre-2.6.0 argv). Additive merge backfills
// the default object; engine behaviour is unchanged until the user edits it.
// v19 (2.6.0): the macOS Cloud-only wall is lifted — the Mac app is a full
// local+cloud app again. Existing Mac installs were force-pinned to appMode
// 'cloud' with no real choice, so reset them to the local default ONCE so they
// land in the now-built local mode; the visible switch flips back anytime.
// Windows/Linux appMode reflects a real user choice and is never touched.
// v20 (2.6.6): added settings.contextDecay (default true) and
// settings.codexSendWindowTokens (default 64000) for the tool-result age decay,
// plus settings.memoryCloudOptIn (plan A7; the DEFAULT moved to true on
// 12.09.2026, this migration is untouched and stays purely additive) and
// settings.codexDefaultMode (default 'ask', plan C1); all four ride the
// default-merge, strictly additive, no one-shot reset (R1 downgrade contract)
// and the paid-provider send cap. STRICTLY ADDITIVE and IDEMPOTENT: the merge
// below fills both defaults in and preserves every existing value, and this
// version adds NO one-shot reset the way v10 and v19 did.
// That is a hard requirement, not a preference (plan R1, DOWNGRADE-KONTRAKT):
// the 2.6.5/2.6.6 A/B share one WebView profile, zustand stamps the OLD
// version back when the old build writes the store, so this migration runs
// AGAIN on the next 2.6.6 start. A one-shot reset here would fire on every
// build switch and quietly wipe a user preference each time.
// v21 (2.6.6): added settings.codexCloudConfirmOptIn (default false) and
// retired settings.codexCloudConfirmShell (default true). Bypass means bypass
// on a cloud model too (2026-08-22, replacing G15a of 2026-08-07), so
// the cloud shell confirm is an opt-in now.
// The key had to be a NEW one, not a flipped default on the old one: this
// store persists the whole settings object, so every existing profile has
// `codexCloudConfirmShell: true` written to disk, and a changed default alone
// would never reach it. Reusing the key would have meant a one-shot reset,
// which the R1 downgrade contract above rules out while 2.6.5 and 2.6.6 share
// one WebView profile. A new key rides the additive merge instead: the default
// fills in for everyone, an opt-in the user makes survives every A/B switch,
// and the stale old key is simply never read again. STRICTLY ADDITIVE and
// IDEMPOTENT, like v20 and unlike v10 and v19.
// v22 (2.6.8): added settings.reasoningEffort (default 'high'), the rung the
// composer's effort control cycles through. STRICTLY ADDITIVE and IDEMPOTENT
// like v20 and v21: the merge below fills the default in, every existing value
// survives, and there is NO one-shot reset. The default equals what the client
// already sent for thinking ON, so a profile that rides this migration sends
// byte-for-byte the same request it sent before.
// v23 (3.0.7): added settings.localEffortChosen (default false). Local
// servers take a rung since issue 176, and without this key the global 'high'
// would have gone to every local model nobody had touched. STRICTLY ADDITIVE
// and IDEMPOTENT like v20 to v22: the merge below fills false in for a profile
// that never had the key, and a true the user set survives every rerun of
// this migration after an A/B switch, because the merge keeps stored values.
