/**
 * Tools that can change something outside the conversation.
 *
 * Two things strip these from a turn's catalog: Code-Review Mode, and a
 * read-only slash command (/review, /plan, /diff, /explain, /find, /todo,
 * /security). Read-only inspectors stay (file_read / file_list /
 * file_search) so the agent can still do the looking the command asked for.
 *
 * Since the 2.6.6 tool merge, shell_execute is the special case: it is
 * mutating (it can run anything), yet it must SURVIVE the read-only strip,
 * because the typed inspectors (git_status, git_log, git_diff, task status)
 * live inside it now. The gate moved from the catalog to the executor:
 * a read-only turn sets a flag (agent-context) and executeShellExecute only
 * runs commands isReadOnlyCommand() approves. allowedInReadOnlyTurn() is
 * what the catalog filters use so this exception lives in one place.
 *
 * Shared between useCodex and useAgentChat so the same command behaves the same
 * in the Code tab and in Agent mode. It lived only in useCodex until 2.5.9,
 * which is part of why the flag was decorative in the first place.
