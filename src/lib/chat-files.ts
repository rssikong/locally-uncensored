/**
 * Any file as a chat attachment (3.0.5, a user on Discord: "let me give
 * the model a ROM file").
 *
 * WHAT A MODEL CAN DO WITH A BINARY. Nothing with the bytes themselves: a
 * language model reads text, and base64 pasted into the prompt is neither
 * readable to it nor affordable (a 16 MB ROM is about 21 million characters).
 * So the chat does two honest things instead:
 *
 *   1. Every chat gets a compact description in place of the bytes: name,
 *      size, the type read from the magic bytes, the SHA-256, a hex dump of
 *      the first bytes and the readable strings found inside. All of it in a
 *      fixed budget, a few kilobytes per file whatever the file weighs.
 *   2. In Agent and Code the file is also copied into the chat's working
 *      folder, where the file and shell tools can work on the real thing.
 *      For a binary the model then gets the facts and the path only (3.0.7):
 *      its tools read the bytes far better than a dump in the prompt does.
 *
 * In plain chat the composer says so when a binary is attached: the model
 * only sees the summary, and Agent or Code is where it gets the file
 * (binarySummaryOnlyMessage). Nothing attached is ever run.
 *
 * WHAT IS STORED. Only the description. The file is not copied into the chat
 * history, not as base64 and not as a reference to a stored blob: the history
 * is serialised as one string on every save, and a few large images in it
 * have taken the renderer down before (chat-attachments.ts, the 127 MiB
 * IndexedDB limit). The description is bounded by the constants below.
 *
 * The same text goes out to a local model and to a cloud model: it is part of
 * the user message, so no provider needs to know about it.
