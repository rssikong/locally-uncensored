/**
 * Phase 6 (v2.4.0) — In-turn tool-result cache.
 *
 * Dedupes identical (toolName, argsHash) calls within a single agent run.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: one agent TURN (from sendAgentMessage or
 * sendInstruction start until the ReAct loop exits). We do NOT cache across
 * turns because many tools return time-sensitive data (web_search results,
 * file_read on a file that may have just been overwritten). Scoping to a single turn keeps the semantics trivial:
 * everything inside one user prompt sees a consistent view of each tool's
 * output; the next user prompt starts fresh.
 *
 * The implementation delegates to the audit store's findCacheCandidate,
 * which indexes completed entries by (convId, toolName, argsHash, startedAt).
 * Turn start time is passed as the cut-off: anything older is treated as
 * belonging to a previous turn and ignored.
