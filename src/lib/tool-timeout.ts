/**
 * Race a tool run against its cap. The timer is CLEARED when the tool wins
 * (audit B10) — the old inline race left every winner's setTimeout parked
 * for up to 615 s with the whole closure alive, times 200 iterations.
 *
 * Fix 2 (klaerung-n5a, Frage 1): `Promise.race` never cancels its loser, it
 * only stops listening to it. Before this, a timed-out tool call reached the
 * model as an error while the real call underneath ran on, unseen, holding
 * whatever local resource it had booked (a sub-agent's local lane, a
 * workflow's), until it ended on its own: the user-visible "Tool execution
 * timed out" was true about the MESSAGE, not about the machine's state.
 *
 * `run` is now a factory, not an already-started promise: it receives the
 * AbortSignal this function owns, so it can build the call's OWN signal
 * (merged with `baseSignal`, the run's Stop) instead of racing a call that
 * was already wired to something else. On timeout that signal is aborted
 * BEFORE the rejection, so the loser gets exactly the same cancellation
 * path Stop already uses, and, for every tool that honours its signal
 * (shell_execute, and now delegate_task/run_workflow, see sub-agent.ts and
 * builtin-tools.ts), actually winds down and releases what it held.
 *
 * Review-Auflage 1 (Opus, review-dtimeout.md): `baseSignal` is the whole
 * run's Stop controller, alive for up to 200 iterations with several
 * parallel tool calls each. Every call used to add its own `abort` listener
 * to it and never remove it, win or lose, hundreds of dead listeners per run
 * pinning their own `AbortController` (and the closure around it) alive for
 * the rest of the run. The handler is a named const now so the SAME
 * reference goes into `removeEventListener` in the shared `.finally()`
 * below, whether the tool call wins, loses, or `run()` throws synchronously
 * (Auflage 4).
 *
 * Review-Auflage 4 (Opus, review-dtimeout.md): `run(controller.signal)` used
 * to be called directly inside the `Promise.race([...])` array literal. A
 * factory that throws SYNCHRONOUSLY (instead of returning a rejected
 * promise) would have thrown straight out of this function, before
 * `Promise.race` and its `.finally()` ever ran: the deadline's `setTimeout`
 * would stay armed for up to ~24.8 days (NO_PRACTICAL_CAP_MS) and its
 * eventual rejection would be unhandled, and `baseSignal`'s listener would
 * leak exactly like Auflage 1. No real factory here throws synchronously
 * today (both callers wrap an `async` function, which never does), so this
 * is hardening against a future caller's mistake, not a live bug.
