/**
 * Phase 7 (v2.4.0) — Per-tool error-recovery hints.
 *
 * When a tool fails, the raw error string (`Error: ENOENT: no such file`)
 * is often opaque to a small model and triggers redundant retries. A short
 * structured hint appended to the error ("Path not found. Use file_list
 * first to discover existing paths.") yields dramatically better recovery
 * behaviour — the agent reaches for the right follow-up tool instead of
 * retrying the same bad call.
 *
 * Design rules:
 *   - Hints are ≤ ~30 tokens (roughly one sentence) to avoid bloat in the
 *     ReAct history window.
 *   - Match is conservative (RegExp.test on the error string). When no
 *     pattern matches, explainError returns undefined and the caller keeps
 *     the bare error message.
 *   - Hints are plain text, no code fencing, no Markdown headers.
