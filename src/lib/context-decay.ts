/**
 * Age decay for tool results (2.6.6, plan A1).
 *
 * The largest single cost leak in a long coding run: every tool result the
 * agent ever saw rode along VERBATIM in every following request. A run that
 * reads three 50k files pays for those 150k characters again on step 4, 5, 6
 * and on to step 40. The upstream bills the whole prompt every time.
 *
 * The fix is age, not size. A result the model looked at two iterations ago has
 * already done its job: the model either used it or moved on. So results older
 * than the newest iteration are sent head+tail-capped, while the newest
 * iteration stays byte-for-byte intact. That last part is the binding
 * behavioural rule (plan meta-rule 4, learned from the Morgan incident and the
 * 80-character-stub loop): the model must never edit against content it can no
 * longer see, and the content it is working on right now is always the content
 * it just fetched.
 *
 * Three properties this module has to keep:
 *
 *  1. BUILDER ONLY. Decay happens on a copy made while the request is built.
 *     The store, the persisted history and the visible transcript keep the full
 *     result, so the whole feature is reversible and the schema is unchanged.
 *  2. DETERMINISTIC AND FINAL. The cap is a fixed character budget, never a
 *     budget derived from the model window, so the same result always yields
 *     the same bytes. Per step at most ONE iteration crosses the age line;
 *     everything before it is byte-identical to the previous step, which is
 *     what makes the upstream prefix cache work at all (plan A3).
 *  3. STABLE ACROSS A RESTORE. A result the run already sent capped at 4k is
 *     restored at exactly those 4k bytes. The tighter 1.5k restore budget is
 *     for results the run never capped, i.e. results that were shorter than
 *     the in-run cap to begin with.

/**
 * Bound the WORKING history the loop carries from step to step.

 * description. Trimming to the exact budget on every request means dropping
 * about two more messages every step, so the window start creeps forward every
 * step and the prompt prefix is never the same twice, no matter how the request
 * builder is tuned. Waiting until the carried array is 15 percent over budget
 * and then dropping it to 70 percent instead leaves the window start on the
 * same message for several steps running, and everything from there on is
 * byte-identical. Measured over a 30-step plateau: 3 prefix moves instead of
 * 18.
 *
 * Two rules keep it honest:
 *
 *  - it drops whole MESSAGES, it never shortens one. Decay stays the only
 *    thing that touches content, and it stays on the send copy alone, so the
 *    store and the next session keep every result whole.
 *  - the budget check runs on the DECAYED sizes, because that is what the
 *    request will actually cost. Measuring the raw sizes here would throw away
 *    messages that fit comfortably once decay has done its work.
 *
 * Stateless: the decision comes from the array being carried, never from a
 * watermark, so a step aborted halfway strands nothing.
 *
 * With `hysteresis` off the band collapses to the plain budget, which is what
 * the contextDecay notaus wants: a support case that flips the switch should
 * land on the 2.6.5 window, not on a third behaviour nobody has ever seen.
